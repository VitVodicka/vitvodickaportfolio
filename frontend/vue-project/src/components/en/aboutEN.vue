<h2>About me</h2>
<p style="color: lightgray;">
  I am a software developer with over two years of experience in C#, web technologies, and working with APIs. I enjoy finding sensible solutions, simplifying things, and, above all, improving what can work better. I like learning new technologies and quickly getting to grips with them, whether they are backend, frontend, or more complex.
</p><p style="color: lightgray;">Thanks to my diverse experience from projects and abroad, I am able to work independently, take responsibility, and see tasks through to completion. I am not just interested in "making it work," but in ensuring that the result has real value and is sustainable for the future. I am looking for an environment where I can combine technical skills with initiative, come up with ideas for improvement, and move projects and the team forward.</p>
